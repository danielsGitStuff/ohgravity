ohgravity
=========

A simple simulation of particles and gravity written in Java.
It makes use of OpenGl and multithreading. 

When particles collide they will merge and heat up a bit (and turn red). 
When a certain temperature is reached they blow up to many cool particles.
The heavier a particle is the more blueish it will become.
So hot and heavy particles are pink.

Feel free to use the code for whatever you want, except starting a nuclear war.
